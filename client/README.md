## Welcome to Post It!

I created this app so the user doesn't have to
worry about putting post its everywhere around their
desk on a work day. 

The user can have a page that stores all notes they want
to make it to themselves, and they can delete those notes
at any point.

### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [IconifyReact](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/react/)

## Getting Started

* On the client folder

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
## I hope you enjoy it!
